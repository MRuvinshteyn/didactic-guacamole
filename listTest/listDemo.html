It was captioned good morning. Today, I met Manda at her homeless encampment where she made me a cup of coffee!\\n\\nMost of the time I meet homeless people in person on the streets or in a homeless shelter. Then we often connect online and become friends. Manda and I became friends online first. I got to know her a little before seeing how she survives homelessness.  I am having a hard time processing it all. Lots of emotions both good and bad right now! \\n\\nManda is an amazing woman. She is disabled from severe brain trauma, yet because she is high functioning, she falls through the gaps in the safety net. I have been working with her trying to help find a path out of homelessness, but the walls bureaucracy are impossible to break through. \\n\\nFor all the people that believe homeless people are lazy, I wish they could just spend an hour in Manda's shoes! She works hard to keep her tent camp clean. She works hard getting to treatment and therapy. She works hard every single day trying to survive. And she works extremely hard to stay positive while facing the madness of homelessness each and every day! \\n\\nWe must get Manda out from under that bridge into housing. Because of her health and being a woman out on the streets, she is extremely vulnerable living outside. If you are connected to social services in Seattle or know anyone that is, please reach out to them and forward Manda's story. I have talked to her social worker. Her health issues are severe, and we need to get this woman inside! \\n\\nManda vlogs on her Facebook page you can find here https://www.facebook.com/mandycampmom/\\n\\nIf you'd like to help support her directly this is her GoFundMe page https://www.gofundme.com/4qcfk0o\\n\\nYou can also find Manda on Twitter https://twitter.com/RicherAmanda\\n\\n________________________________________________\\n\\nSubscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/c/invisiblepeople?sub_confirmation=1\\n\\nInvisible People's website:\\n\\nhttp://invisiblepeople.tv\\n\\nSupport Invisible People:\\n\\nhttps://invisiblepeople.tv/donate\\n\\nOn Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/invisiblepeople\\n\\nInvisible People's Social Media: \\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/invisiblepeople\\nhttps://twitter.com/invisiblepeople\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/invisiblepeople\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/invisiblepeopletv\\n\\nMark Horvath's Twitter: \\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/hardlynormal\\n\\nAbout Invisible People: \\n\\nSince its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, they're on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.\\n\\nInvisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can't ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation's most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath – its founder – and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America's homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.\\n\\nInvisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness."},{"video_id":"Pc1Obe1BWhc","trending_date":"18.05.01","title":"Nina Dobrev wants to Save Sharks (30s)","channel_title":"Oceana","category_id":"29","publish_time":"2018-01-03T16:01:48.000Z","tags":"Sharks|Nina Dobrev|Shark finning|PSA","views":"4178","likes":"16","dislikes":"1","comment_count":"3","thumbnail_link":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pc1Obe1BWhc/default.jpg","comments_disabled":"False","ratings_disabled":"False","video_error_or_removed":"False","description":"While shark finning is illegal in U.S. waters, shark fins – including imports from countries that allow finning – continue to be bought and sold throughout the U.S. The demand for shark fins is one of the greatest threats facing shark populations around the world.\\n\\nThose interested in learning about the campaign can visit www.oceana.org/SaveSharks for additional information."},{"video_id":"ESRAQtXVQL0","trending_date":"18.12.01","title":"Homeless little boy gets a bed for Christmas","channel_title":"Humble Design","category_id":"29","publish_time":"2018-01-09T02:00:25.000Z","tags":"charity|humble design|detroit|design|home|feels|homeless|heart|helping|children|sad|crying|cry","views":"23634","likes":"131","dislikes":"13","comment_count":"23","thumbnail_link":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESRAQtXVQL0/default.jpg","comments_disabled":"False","ratings_disabled":"False","video_error_or_removed":"False","description":"Daeyers is eight years old and has been homeless for years.
